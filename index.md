Research in my lab is broadly focused on avian ecology, behavior, and conservation. Integrating field biology, quantitative models, and ecological theory we are interested in a diverse set of questions aimed at understanding how biological populations and communities respond to environmental variables across space and time.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Long-term diversity dynamics of Afromontane tropical forest bird communities
- Elevational patterns of habitat specialization
- Partial migration of Red-headed Woodpeckers
- Evolution of avian eye color
- Effects of artifical light at night on Chimney swift roosting behavior
