I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Fairleigh Dickinson University. Research in my lab is broadly focused on avian ecology, behavior, and conservation. Integrating field biology, quantitative models, and ecological theory our primary goals are to understand and quantify how biological populations and communities respond to environmental variables across space and time and identify how and what speciesâ€™ characteristics determine those responses.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Long-term diversity dynamics of Afromontane tropical forest bird communities
- Partial migration of Red-headed Woodpeckers
- Evolution of avian eye color
- Effects of artifical light at night on Chimney swift roosting behavior
